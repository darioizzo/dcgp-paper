# Summary

Genetic Programming (GP), is a computational technique based on the idea of representing a computer program in some dedicated data-structure (e.g. a tree) to then evolve it using genetic algorithms as to improve its *fitness* at solving a predefined task. The idea flourished in the late 80s mainly thanks to the work of John Koza [@koza:2010], and (using the words of Koza) has always had a "hidden skeleton in the closet": the difficulty to find and evolve real valued parameters in the expressed program. A recent development called **differentiable
genetic programming** [@izzo:2017], was introduced to address exactly this issue by allowing to learn constants in computer programs using the
differential information of the program outputs as obtained using automated differentiation techniques. 

The evolution of a **differentiable genetic program** can be supported by using the information on the derivatives (at any order) of the program outputs with respect to chosen parameters, enabling in GP the equivalent of back-propagation in Artificial Neural Networks (ANN). The fitness of a program can thus be defined also in terms of its derivatives, allowing to go beyond symbolic regression tasks and, for example, to solve differential equations, learn differential models, capture conserved quantities in dynamical systems, search for Lyapunov functions in controlled systems, etc.

In this work we introduce the C++ library `dcgp` and the Python package `dcgpy`, tools we developed to allow research into the applications enabled by **differentiable genetic programming**. In the rest of this paper, we will refer mainly to `dcgp`, with the understanding that the a corresponding behaviour can always be also obtained in `dcgpy`.

# Methods 

In `dcgp` computer programs are encoded using the Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) encoding [@miller:2011], that is an acyclic graph
representation. A Cartesian genetic program, in its original form, is depicted in \autoref{fig:cgp} and is defined by the number of inputs $n$, the number of outputs $m$, the number of rows $r$, the number of columns $c$, the levels-back $l$, the arity $a$ of its functional units (*kernels*) and the set of possible *kernels*. With reference to \autoref{fig:cgp}, each of the $n + rc$ nodes in a CGP is assigned a unique id. The vector of integers:
$$
\mathbf x_I = [F_0, C_{0,0}, C_{0,1}, ...,  C_{0, a}, F_1, C_{1,0}, ....., O_1, O_2, ..., O_m]
$$
defines entirely the value of the terminal nodes and thus the computer program.

Several *kernels* are already available in `dcgp`, but users can define their own both in the C++ and in the Python version, allowing for the possibility to consider kernels that are, themselves, genetic programs.

In `dcgp` the CGP representations of programs are all derived from a base C++ templated class `dcgp::expression<T>`. The use of the
template parameter `T` allows to compute the nodes of the acyclic graph defining the computer program, and thus its outputs, using different computational types. In particular, the use of **generalized dual numbers**, implemented as a new type in the library `audi` [@audi:2020], are enabled and can be used to obtain the derivatives, at any order, of the program outputs with respect to parameters present in its encoding. **Generalized dual numbers** implement the algebra of truncated Taylor polynomials and act, in this context, as a high order, forward mode, automated differentiation method.

The two classes `dcgp::expression_weighted<T>` and `dcgp::expression_ann` derive from the base class `dcgp::expression<T>` and offer
new, extended, kinds of CGP representations. `dcgp::expression_weighted<T>` adds a weight to each node connection and thus creates a program rich in floating point constants to be learned. `dcgp::expression_ann` adds also a bias to each node, thus making it possible to represent generic artificial neural networks. Since forward mode automated differentiation is highly unefficient whenever a high number of parameters are to be learned (a typical situation when training ANN weights and biases), ```dcgp::expression_ann``` is only allowed to operate on the type ```double```. Its weights and biases can be learned using backward mode automated differentiation (back propagation) and a stochastic gradient descent algorithm implemented specifically for the class.

All computer programs represented in `dcgp` can be *mutated* via the corresponding methods of the ```dcgp::expression<T>``` base class, and thus evolved. Mutations can be chosen selectively to affect only specific part of the chromosome, thus affecting only the *kernels*, the connections or the output nodes. As an example, the different consequences of such mutations are visualized, in the case of a `dcgp::expression_ann`, in \autoref{fig:ann_mut} and studied preliminarily in [@martens:2019].

![Effects of mutations on a dCGPANN.\label{fig:ann_mut}](ann_mut.png)

When using a `dcgp::expression<T>` for a symbolic regression task, `dcgp` includes also
several novel evolutionary startegies [@schwefel:1993], **memetic** and **multiobjective**, as well as a dedicated
`dcgp::symbolic_regression` class that represents such problems as an optimization problem.

# Notes on efficiency

The process of evolving a CGP can be lengthy and, being subject to a degree of randomness, is typically repeated a few times 
to explore the diversity of possible evolved solutions. As a consequence, CPU efficiency is an enabler to build a successful learning pipeline. In the C++ library `dcgp` there are several parallelization levels that can be exploited for this purpose. To start with, the program loss with respect to its expected output, can be parallelized when computed on multiple points. A second layer of parallelization is offered by `audi` [@audi:2020] when **generalized dual numbers** are employed. In this case, the underlying truncated Taylor polynomial algebra makes use of fine grained parallelized arithmetic primitives provided by the `obake`  [@obake:2020]
library. A third layer is also present in the non **memetic** optimization algorithms shipped with `dcgp` as they can evaluate the fitness of the various individuals in parallel using a batch fitness evaluator. All the resulting nested parallelism is dealt with using the Â®Intel threading building blocks library.
In the Python package `dcgpy` things are different as multi-threading is not permitted by the Python interpreter and the multi-process  paradigm is highly unefficient for a fine grained parallelization. As a consequence, most of the mentioned parallelization are unavailable. 
The use of coarse-grained parallelization paradigms, such as the island model for evolutionary algorithms, is thus suggested to achieve
the best out of `dcgpy` computational times.

# C++ and Python APIs

Two separate APIs are maintained for the C++ and Python version of the code. While the APIs are
designed to be as close as possible, and to offer a similar experience, there are inevitable differences
stemming from the very different capabilities of the languages (to mention one, think about the
lack of an equivalent to C++ templates in Python).

In Python a typical initial use of the `dcgpy` package, would look like:
```python
import dcgpy
ks = dcgpy.kernel_set_double(["sum", "diff", "div", "mul"])
ex = dcgpy.expression_double(inputs = 1, outputs = 1, rows = 1, 
                cols = 6, levels_back = 6, arity  = 2, kernels = ks())
print("Numerical output: ", ex([1.2]))
print("Symbolic output: ", ex(["x"]))
ex.mutate_active(2)
print("Numerical output: ", ex([1.2]))
print("Symbolic output: ", ex(["x"]))
```
and produce the output:
```
Numerical output:  [1.7]
Symbolic output:  ['((x/(x+x))+x)']
Numerical output:  [1.68]
Symbolic output:  ['((x*(x+x))-x)']
``` 
while in C++ a typical use of the `dcgp` library achieving a similar result would look like: 
```c++
#include <dcgp.hpp>
int main() {
    dcgp::kernel_set<double> ks({"sum", "diff", "div", "mul"});
    dcgp::expression<double> ex(1u, 1u, 1u, 6u, 6u, 2u, ks());
    std::cout << "Numerical output: ", ex({1.2})) << "\n";
    std::cout << "Symbolic output: ", ex({"x"})) << "\n";
    ex.mutate_active(2);
    std::cout << "Numerical output: ", ex({1.2})) << "\n";
    std::cout << "Symbolic output: ", ex({"x"})) << "\n";
```
